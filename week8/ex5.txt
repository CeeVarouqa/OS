What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

Physical address: the address of memory where the data is saved, which means the hardware address of RAM.

Virtual address of memory: It's the address of virtual page where the data is saved, this address might be physically located
not in RAM(depending on OS) but the client of OS does not know about this.
